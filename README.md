**NBBinder** generates a navigable book-like structure to a collection of Jupyter notebooks.

## Description

The main function in this module is called `bind()`. It reads a collection of Jupyter notebooks from a given directory and, upon configuration,

- adds a **table of contents** to a selected notebook file, with links to the other notebooks;

- adds a **header** cell to each notebook, with custom information about the collection of notebooks;

- adds a **badge** cell to each notebook, with links to opening the notebooks in different platforms or formats. For instance, one can include a **Google Colab badge** and a **Binder badge**, with links to opening each notebook in these cloud computing plataforms, a badge for showing **slides** as exported with `nbconvert`, and so on.

- adds **navigator links**, at the beggining and at the end of each notebook, with links to traverse to the previous and the next notebook, and to other selected notebooks, such as the Table of Contents and the References;

- **exports** the notebooks to other formats using `nbconvert`, so that, for example, **slides** can be generated automatically and in bulk.

## Example

The most convenient way to use the module, or script, is via a configuration file. The configuration files are written in the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format.

### Example configuration file

For instance, consider the following `config_nb_alice.yml`, which is included in the `tests` folder of the repository:

```yaml
# Configuration file for the python module NBBinder

version: 0.12a

path_to_notes: nb_builds/nb_alice

contents:
  toc_nb_name: 00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb
  toc_title: Table of Contents
  show_index_in_toc: True

header: "NBBinder test on a collection of notebooks named after the chapters of 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'"

navigators:
  core_navigators:
    - 00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb
  show_nb_title_in_nav: False
  show_index_in_nav: False
```

### Notebook collection

The following collection of indexed notebooks is built in the folder `tests/nb_builds/nb_alice`:

```text
00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb
01.00-Down_the_Rabbit-Hole.ipynb
02.00-The_Pool_of_Tears.ipynb
03.00-A_Caucus-Race_and_a_Long_Tale.ipynb
04.00-The_Rabbit_Sends_in_a_Little_Bill.ipynb
05.00-Advice_from_a_Caterpillar.ipynb
06.00-Pig_and_Pepper.ipynb
07.00-A_Mad_Tea-Party.ipynb
08.00-The_Queen's_Croquet-Ground.ipynb
09.00-The_Mock_Turtle's_Story.ipynb
10.00-The_Lobster_Quadrille.ipynb
11.00-Who_Stole_the_Tarts?.ipynb
12.00-Alice's_Evidence.ipynb
```

### Binding the collection

One way to bind the collection of notebooks is to import the module and use the `bind()` function with this configuration file as argument:

```python
import nbbinder as nbb
nbb.bind('config_nb_alice.yml')
```

Or we execute it as a script in the command line:

```bash
./nbbinder.py config_nb_alice.yml
```

In the `tests` directory, the configuration file is actually not in the same folder as the script. The collection is two folders down. This is indicated by the argument `path_to_notes: nb_builds/nb_alice`, given in the configuration file.

### Result

After binding the notebooks in one of the two ways mentioned above, the following table of contents is inserted in the first notebook `00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb`:

## [Table of Contents](#/)

### [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](#/)

### [1. Down the Rabbit-Hole](#/)

### [2. The Pool of Tears](#/)

### [3. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale](#/)

### [4. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill](#/)

### [5. Advice from a Caterpillar](#/)

### [6. Pig and Pepper](#/)

### [7. A Mad Tea-Party](#/)

### [8. The Queen's Croquet-Ground](#/)

### [9. The Mock Turtle's Story](#/)

### [10. The Lobster Quadrille](#/)

### [11. Who Stole the Tarts?](#/)

### [12. Alice's Evidence](#/)

The links above have been changed for display here, but in the actual table of contents they link to the corresponding notebook.

See [00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb](tests/nb_builds/nb_alice/00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb) for the bound version of the first notebook. Notice the **header** in the begining of the notebook and the **navigator** cells after the header and at the end of the notebook. Experiment with the navigator links to move to the other notebooks.

## Other examples

By appropriately naming the files, we can have different formattings for the *Table of Contents*. 

### Notebooks with subsections

For instance, if your list of files is

```(text)
00.00-Front_Page.ipynb
02.00-Introduction.ipynb
04.00-Project_Requirements.ipynb
05.00-The_History_of_Grammar.ipynb
06.00-Parts_of_Speech.ipynb
06.02-Nouns.ipynb
06.03-Verbs.ipynb
06.05-Adjectives.ipynb
06.08-Adverbs.ipynb
08.00-Sentences.ipynb
08.01-Complex_Sentences.ipynb
08.03-Compound_Sentences.ipynb
09.00-Paragraphs.ipynb
09.01-Descriptive.ipynb
09.02-Expository.ipynb
09.03-Narrative.ipynb
09.04-Persuasive.ipynb
11.00-Conclusion.ipynb
AB.00-Appendix.ipynb
BA.00-Glossary.ipynb
BC.02-Bibliography.ipynb
BC.04-Index.ipynb
```
we get the *Table of Contents*

The binder for the notebooks in this collection is configured to include a *badge* to open them in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). The *badge* is located just below the header. Just click the badge with the **mouse right button** for to open it. If clicking it with the right button, from within github, nothing will happen.
