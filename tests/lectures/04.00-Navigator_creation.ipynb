This is useful for direct links to the **Table of Contents** and the **Bibliography**, for instance. If it is not provided, it is assumed to be an empty list, and nothing is showed in between the links for the *previous* and *next* notebooks.\n",

    "- `app_to_notes_path` is a non-required argument, with the name of the folder in which both the `toc_nb_name` file and the collection of all notebooks to be listed in the table of contents are expected to be. It should be either an absolute path or a path relative from where the code is being ran. If `app_to_notes_path` is not given, it is assumed to be the current directory. \n",

This works if the notebooks are in a github repository. It defaults to `False`.\n",
