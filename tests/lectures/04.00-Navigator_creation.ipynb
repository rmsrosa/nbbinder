    "- `core_navigators` is a list of strings, where each element is the filename of a Jupyter notebook that you want to appear in the navigator bar, in between the links to the *previous* and the *next* notebooks. This is useful for direct links to the **Table of Contents** and the **Bibliography**, for instance. If it is not provided, it is assumed to be an empty list, and nothing is showed in between the links for the *previous* and *next* notebooks.\n",

    "- `app_to_notes_path` is a non-required argument, with the name of the folder in which both the `toc_nb_name` file and the collection of all notebooks to be listed in the table of contents are expected to be. It should be either an absolute path or a path relative from where the code is being ran. If `app_to_notes_path` is not given, it is assumed to be the current directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `repository` is the name of the github repository which the notebooks belong to, if they do belong to one. It defaults to a blank string.\n",

    "- `show_colab` is a `boolean` argument informing the method whether to display the badge with the link to open up the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) environment in the \"cloud\". This works if the notebooks are in a github repository. It defaults to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `show_binder` is a `boolean` argument informing the method whether to display the badge with the link to open up the notebook in the [binder](https://mybinder.org/) environment in the \"cloud\". This works if the notebooks are in a github repository. It defaults to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `show_full_entry_in_nav` indicates whether to display the chapter and section numbers in the navigation links along with the titles or just the titles. It defaults to `True`.\n",
