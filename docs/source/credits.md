This package is based on modules available in the subdirectory [`tools`](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/tree/master/tools) of the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook), by [Jake VanderPlas](http://vanderplas.com/).

In February 2018, I modified and packaged the tools as a single module named [`jupyterbookmaker`](https://github.com/rmsrosa/jupyterbookmaker). This was used in my classroom notes on Mathematical Modelling, taught on early 2018. The notes are available (in Portuguese) at the [github repository for Modelagem Matem√°tica - IM/UFRJ](https://github.com/rmsrosa/modelagem_matematica.).

At the end of 2019, the package was significantly improved and renamed [`nbbinder`](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder).
