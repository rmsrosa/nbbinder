# Overview

**NBBinder** generates a navigable book-like structure to a collection of Jupyter notebooks.

## Description

The main function in this module is called `bind()`. It reads a collection of Jupyter notebooks from a given directory and, upon configuration,

- adds a **table of contents** to a selected notebook file, with links to the other notebooks;

- adds a **header** cell to each notebook, with custom information about the collection of notebooks;

- adds a **badge** cell to each notebook, with links to opening the notebooks in different platforms or formats. For instance, on can include a **Google Colab badge** and a **Binder badge**, with links to opening each notebook in these cloud computing plataforms, a badge for showing **slides** as exported with `nbconvert`, and so on.

- adds **navigator links**, at the beggining and at the end of each notebook, with links to traverse to the previous and the next notebook, and to other selected notebooks, such as the Table of Contents and the References;

- **exports** the notebooks to other formats using `nbconvert`, so that, for example, **slides** can be generated automatically and in bulk.

## Functions

The function `bind()` can be called in two different ways:

- *directly with the arguments* to be applied in the bindind process; or
- *with a configuration file* as argument, with the configuration file containing the desired arguments.

The `bind()` function calls the following functions in this module, which take care of each of the main features of the notebook binder:

- `reindex()`: reorder the notebooks when a new notebook is to be inserted between others or whether there are gaps in the indices;
- `add_contents()`: adds the Table of Contents to a selected "Contents" file;
- `add_headers()`: adds a header to each notebook with a given custom information;
- `add_badges()`: adds a badge cell to each notebook with one or more badges to open up the document in different platforms or formats;
- `add_navigators()`: adds navigation bars to the top and bottom of each notebook.
- `export_notebooks()`: exports the notebooks to any of the different formats as provided by [nbconvert](https://pypi.org/project/nbconvert/): HTML, LaTeX, PDF, Reveal JS, Markdown (md), ReStructured Text (rst), executable script. Notice that `add_badges()` can be used to link to the exported notebooks, useful, for instance, to access slides of the notebooks for presentation in class.

Each of these later functions can be called separately, if only some of these features are desired.

When running `nbbinder.py` as a script, it expects the filename of the configuration file and calls the function `bind(config_file)`, where config_file is the name of the configuration file.

Look at the documentation for more information on each of these functions and for the other functions available on this package.

## Examples

### A little taste

For instance, upon proper configuration (see section [Notebooks with slides and cloud computing badges](#notebooks-with-slides-and-cloud-computing-badges) below), the collection of bare notebooks in  the folder [Water bare collection](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_source/nb_water) is bound to the folder
[Water bound collection](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_water), and, in particular, the file [00.00-Water_Contents.ipynb](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_water/00.00-Water_Contents.ipynb) receives a table of contents, a header, navigator cells and the badges

[![](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_water/00.00-Water_Contents.ipynb)[![](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rmsrosa/nbbinder/master?filepath=tests/nb_builds/nb_water/00.00-Water_Contents.ipynb)[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/view%20in-nbviewer-orange)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_water/00.00-Water_Contents.ipynb)[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-slides-darkgreen)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_water_slides/00.00-Water_Contents.slides.html)

Below we show some examples in more details.

### Example with configuration file

The most convenient way to use the module, or script, is via a configuration file. The configuration files are written in the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format.

For instance, consider the following `config_nb_alice.yml`, which is included in the `tests` folder of the repository:

```yaml
# Configuration file for the python module NBBinder

version: 0.13a

path_to_notes: nb_builds/nb_alice

contents:
  toc_nb_name: 00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb
  toc_title: Table of Contents
  show_index_in_toc: True

header: "NBBinder test on a collection of notebooks named after the chapters of 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'"

navigators:
  core_navigators:
    - 00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb
  show_nb_title_in_nav: False
  show_index_in_nav: False
```

Then, we import the module and use the `bind()` function with this configuration file as argument:

```python
import nbbinder as nbb
nbb.bind('config_nb_alice.yml')
```

Or we execute it as a script in the command line:

```bash
./nbbinder.py config.yml
```

The key `path_to_notes` indicates that the notebooks are in the folder `nb_builds/nb_alice`, relative to where the script that calls the function `bind()` is located. In this folder, one finds the following notebooks, properly indexed:

```text
00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb
01.00-Down_the_Rabbit-Hole.ipynb
02.00-The_Pool_of_Tears.ipynb
03.00-A_Caucus-Race_and_a_Long_Tale.ipynb
04.00-The_Rabbit_Sends_in_a_Little_Bill.ipynb
05.00-Advice_from_a_Caterpillar.ipynb
06.00-Pig_and_Pepper.ipynb
07.00-A_Mad_Tea-Party.ipynb
08.00-The_Queen's_Croquet-Ground.ipynb
09.00-The_Mock_Turtle's_Story.ipynb
10.00-The_Lobster_Quadrille.ipynb
11.00-Who_Stole_the_Tarts?.ipynb
12.00-Alice's_Evidence.ipynb
```

The function `bind()` then reads the notebooks and *binds* them accordingly. In particular, the following table of contents is added to the file indicated by the key `toc_nb_name` in the configuration file:

```text
Table of Contents
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
1. Down the Rabbit-Hole
2. The Pool of Tears
3. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
4. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
5. Advice from a Caterpillar
6. Pig and Pepper
7. A Mad Tea-Party
8. The Queen's Croquet-Ground
9. The Mock Turtle's Story
10. The Lobster Quadrille
11. Who Stole the Tarts?
12. Alice's Evidence
```

See [00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_alice/00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb) for the actual bound version of the first notebook. Notice the **header** in the begining of the notebook and the **navigator** cells after the header and at the end of the notebook. Experiment with the navigator links to move to the other notebooks.

### Notebooks with subsections

By appropriately naming the files, we can have different formattings for the *Table of Contents*. For instance, if your list of files is

```text
00.00-Front_Page.ipynb
01.00-Introduction.ipynb
02.00-Project_Requirements.ipynb
03.00-The_History_of_Grammar.ipynb
04.00-Parts_of_Speech.ipynb
04.01-Nouns.ipynb
04.02-Verbs.ipynb
04.03-Adjectives.ipynb
04.04-Adverbs.ipynb
05.00-Sentences.ipynb
05.01-Complex_Sentences.ipynb
05.02-Compound_Sentences.ipynb
06.00-Paragraphs.ipynb
06.01-Descriptive.ipynb
06.02-Expository.ipynb
06.03-Narrative.ipynb
06.04-Persuasive.ipynb
07.00-Conclusion.ipynb
A0.00-Appendix.ipynb
BA.00-Glossary.ipynb
BB.00-Bibliography.ipynb
BC.00-Index.ipynb
```

we get, with a suitable configuration, the *Table of Contents*

```text
Table of Contents
Front Page
1. Introduction
2. Project Requirements
3. The History of Grammar
4. Parts of Speech
  4.1. Nouns
  4.2. Verbs
  4.3. Adjectives
  4.4. Adverbs
5. Sentences
  5.1. Complex Sentences
  5.2. Compound Sentences
6. Paragraphs
  6.1. Descriptive
  6.2. Expository
  6.3. Narrative
  6.4. Persuasive
7. Conclusion
A. Appendix
Glossary
Bibliography
Index
```

See [00.00-Front-Page.ipynb](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_grammar_bound/00.00-Front_Page.ipynb) for the actual bound version of the first notebook.

The binder for the notebooks in this collection is configured to include *badges* to render, in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), either the Jupyter notebook itself or the exported version to markdown. The *badge* cell is located just below the header. Just click the badge with the **mouse right button** to open it. If clicking it with the right button, from within github, nothing will happen.

### Notebooks with preheaders

This is particularly useful for lectures notes. For instance, by naming your collection of notebooks as

```text
00.00-Introduction.ipynb
01.00.Lecture-Math_Background.ipynb
01.01-Vector_Calculus.ipynb
01.02-Rigid_Motions.ipynb
02.00.Lecture-Kinematics.ipynb
02.01.Lecture-Velocity_and_Acceleration.ipynb
02.02.Lecture-Different_Types_of_Motions_and_Their_Components.ipynb
03.00.Lecture-Dynamics.ipynb
03.01..Part-Force_and_Momentum.ipynb
03.02..Part-Orbits_of_Planets_and_Satellites.ipynb
03.03..Part-Interception_and_Rendezvous.ipynb
04.00.Lecture-Trajectory_Optimization.ipynb
04.01.Lecture.Part-Performance.ipynb
04.02.Lecture.Part-Gravity_Turn.ipynb
04.03.Lecture.Part-Optimization.ipynb
AA.00-References.ipynb
```

we get, with a suitable configuration, the *Table of Contents*

```text
Contents
Introduction
Lecture 1. Math Background
  1.1. Vector Calculus
  1.2. Rigid Motions
Lecture 2. Kinematics
  Lecture 2.1. Velocity and Acceleration
  Lecture 2.2. Different Types of Motions and Their Components
Lecture 3. Dynamics
  Part 1. Force and Momentum
  Part 2. Orbits of Planets and Satellites
  Part 3. Interception and Rendezvous
Lecture 4. Trajectory Optimization
  Lecture 4. Part 1. Performance
  Lecture 4. Part 2. Gravity Turn
  Lecture 4. Part 3. Optimization
References
```

See [00.00-Introduction.ipynb](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_alice/00.00-Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.ipynb) for the actual bound version of the first notebook.

Notice, above, different forms of displaying the parts of the same lecture note.

The binder for the notebooks in this collection is configured to include a *badge* to open them in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). The *badge* is located just below the header. Just click the badge with the **mouse right button** to open it. If clicking it with the right button, from within github, nothing will happen.

## Notebooks with slides and cloud computing badges

The following configuration file is used in the collection of files present in the folder [Water](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/source/nb_water):

```yaml
# Configuration file for the python module NBBinder

version: 0.13a

path_to_notes: nb_builds/nb_water

contents:
  toc_nb_name: 00.00-Water_Contents.ipynb
  toc_title: Table of Contents
  show_index_in_toc: True

header: "[*NBBinder test on a collection of notebooks about some thermodynamic properperties of water*](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder)"

navigators:
  core_navigators:
    - 00.00-Water_Contents.ipynb
    - BA.00-References.ipynb
  show_nb_title_in_nav: True
  show_index_in_nav: False

badges:
  - title: Open in Google Colab

    label: view in
    message: nbviewer
    color: orange
  - title: View Slides
    url: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_water_slides
    extension: .slides.html
    label: view
    message: slides
    color: darkgreen

exports:
  - export_path: nb_builds/nb_water_slides
    exporter_name: slides
    exporter_args:
      reveal_scroll: True
```

After binding the collection, the folder [Water bound collection](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_water) is created. See [00.00-Water_Contents.ipynb](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_water/00.00-Water_Contents.ipynb) for the first notebook, containing the table of contents. Now, each notebook has a badge cell with badges to open the notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), [Binder](https://mybinder.org), and [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), and a final badge to open the associated [Reveal.JS](https://revealjs.com/) slides.

For the slides, the folder [Water Slides](https://github.com/rmsrosa/nbbinder/blob/master/tests/nb_builds/nb_water_slides) is created via [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), in accordance to the parameters associated with the key `exports` in the configuration file.

The **badge cell** looks like
